            <p>
                DJS Racing is a team of 50 engineering students representing our college at the Formula Student competitions; where we design and manufacture a formula style racecar. DJS Racing started back in 2012 with a team of few passionate engineering students coming
                together to create a racecar with the limited resources they had access to, since then we have grown leaps and bounds. We participated in Formula Student Germany 2014, and despite it being our debut season the team members displayed exceptional
                skills in understanding the concept behind developing a race car. Our second vehicle, which was built by team of 50 members participated in Formula Student India 2016 which was held at Buddh International Circuit. The team stood 6th amongst
                50 participating teams from all over the country. Our car was exceptionally a well designed car and was acclaimed by the judges who saw a lot of potential and promise in us.
            </p>

            <h3 class="center Orbitron red-text">Our Mission</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    To excite and encourage young people to take up a career in engineering and to challenge university students to conceive, design, build, cost, present and compete as a team with a formula style racing car in a series of static and dynamic competitions

            <h3 class="center Orbitron red-text">Learning</h3>
            <p>
                As a student, taking part in Formula Student gives you the chance to demonstrate your technical, engineering design, and manufacturing skills. Team members also learn important lessons on team working, time management, project management, budgeting and
                presentation: all things that any prospective employer will be looking for. As a member of this team, each student goes through a steep learning curve and reaps great benefits of the time and effort he has invested throughout his tenure
                in the team. A Formula student graduate experiences growth on both professional and personal fronts.

            <p>
                Formula Student is an international engineering design competition held by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The goal is to develop and provide a platform for student engineers to experience, build, and learn. These competitions are amongst the
                most prestigious student engineering competitions in the world. The competition provides an opportunity for engineering students to build their own ingenious race car.
            </p>
            <p>
                The format of the event is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a Motorsport competition. As a student, taking
                part in Formula Student gives us the chance to demonstrate our technical, engineering design, and manufacturing skills. Formula Student graduates also find that the professionalism they gain as practicing engineers means they are well
                equipped for their future engineering careers.
